WHAT THE USER NEEDS TO DO (only tested on windows):\
-python 3.6 venv (install tkinter with 3.6)\
-install requirements.txt in both root and neuro\
-extract files from https://github.com/beyretb/AnimalAI-Olympics into the root folder\
-rename this folder to envs\
-rename AnimalAI exe and data folder to aaiv2 and aaiv2_Data\
-apply clyngor-patch to venv/lib/clyngor\
\
hopefully it should work now :) currently it only works on windows\
\
TODO:\
-CHECK ON WEAK_LEARNED LINE 61 LATER (a code change I made to get it to work may affect functionality)
